One-dimensional gradient descent:
    ◦ I explained gradient descent when C is a function of two variables, and when it's a function of more than two variables.
    ◦ What happens when C is a function of just one variable?.
    ◦ Can you provide a geometric interpretation of what gradient descent is doing in the one-dimensional case?

one dimentional means Cost function depends only on one variable either w or x in (w.x+b) C => C(x)
gradient in one dimention
now gradient is not a vector 
it is just dC/dx
it is the slope of the curve at that instant

slope - +ve -> move left
slope - -ve -> move right
