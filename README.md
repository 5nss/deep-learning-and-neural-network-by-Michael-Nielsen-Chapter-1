Chapter 1 – Using Neural Networks to Recognize Handwritten Digits

This chapter focuses on the foundations of neural networks:
how neurons work, why smooth activations matter, and how learning
happens conceptually using gradient descent.

Topics Covered
- Perceptrons vs Sigmoid neurons
- Vectorized feedforward computation
- Cost function
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
