deep-learning-and-neural-network-by-Michael-Nielsen-Chapter-1
A structured, from-scratch study of Chapter 1 of Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen, covering perceptrons, sigmoid neurons, vectorization, and SGD.

Chapter 1 – Using Neural Networks to Recognize Handwritten Digits

This chapter focuses on the foundations of neural networks:
how neurons work, why smooth activations matter, and how learning
happens conceptually using gradient descent.

Topics Covered
- Perceptrons vs Sigmoid neurons
- Vectorized feedforward computation
- Cost function
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
